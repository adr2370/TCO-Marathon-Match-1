TCO-Marathon-Match-1
====================

My solution for the Top Coder Open Marathon Match 1 in 2012. This code got me 37th out of 148.

[Here is a link to the problem on TopCoder][].

Essentially the problem was to convert a random group of white squares to a connected group of white squares with the least moves possible. The board was a square of black and white tiles and to move tiles you slid your tile (starting with black) onto one edge of the square, which pushed each tile in that column or row one square over and you pick up the last piece on that side to use in the next move.

Below is a screenshot of the board completed (left) and in progress (right).
